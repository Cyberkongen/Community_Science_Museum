                <p>There are various ways you can support the museum. Donations are very welcome and are an important way we keep this
                    museum open and accessible to the whole community.
                </p>
                <p>You can also support us by donating items of interest to the museum’s collections. If you have some item or
                    collection that you think others would enjoy, please let us know by contacting our Collections Department and they
                    will be able to assist you.

                <h1>Volunteer</h1>
                <p>A number of people volunteer their time and effort to keep the displays in good order and ready for visitors to come
                    and enjoy.</p>
                <p>Volunteering has its perks including getting to see behind the scenes of a working museum, access to staff-only
                    lectures, and a monthly lunch where all staff and volunteers come together to discuss ideas for future exhibits and
                    strategies for the museum.</p>
                <p>You can help volunteer in a number of different spheres. Please contact us if you’d like to find out more about how
                    you can get involved.</p>
